# Bank-Modelling

In this project, I analyze Portuguese bank data, and particularly its campaign to sell a new product to customers over the phone. The product is a term deposit, where customers deposit their money for a fixed period of time for a fixed interest rate. To understand factors that make a customer more likely to buy the product, I explore the data and use machine learning to build a model to predict whether a customer is likely to buy.
